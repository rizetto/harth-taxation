                        Taxation is the imposition of compulsory levies on individuals
                        or entities by governments in almost every country of the world.
                        Taxation is used primarily to raise revenue for government
                        expenditures, though it can serve other purposes as well.

                        The Contador de Resultas was the Chief Royal Accountant during
                        the 17th and 18th centuries, and his duties were comparable to
                        those of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue today. He served
                        as the Chief Arbitrator, whose financial rulings were binding
                        unless overturned by the Council of Indies. Indirect taxes on
                        tobacco, alcohol, cockpits, burlas, and powder were some of the
                        taxes that were levied on the populace, in addition to a tribute
                        or head tax of one gold maiz per year and taxes on the value of
                        jewels and gold trinkets. The tributo, which was once worth
                        between 8 and 10 reales, is one of the taxes that date back to
                        the Spanish Empire. Another system for paying taxes was polo y
                        servicio or forced labor. Spain eventually replaced tributo with
                        cedula, allowing them to keep track of the people who were able
                        to pay taxes. Another way the Filipinos were taxed was through
                        the encomienda system, which grants land ownership to deserving
                        peninsulares. Other local taxes included the donativo de
                        Zamboanga, which was levied expressly for the conquest of Jolo,
                        and the vinta, which was paid by residents of the provinces
                        along Western Luzon's coast to protect the region against the
                        then-common Muslim pirates.
